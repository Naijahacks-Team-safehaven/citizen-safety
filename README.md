# Problem
There's a rapid increase in rape cases, crime and abuse of human rights in the country right now, with no quick way to contact the needed authorities to help in such cases. 

# Proposed solution

SafeHaven app provides a quick way to contact police officers, hospital personnels, lawyers in the shortest time possible using ussd codes and the light weight web app. The ussd application makes it easy for "not-so literate" citizens to be able to use the app without issues. 

# Proposed stack

Nodejs/Express, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

# Benefits

- Citizens are able to report crime and abuse cases easily and get help in time. 
- USSD application will make it easy for users without data connection to use the app. 
- Videos footage and images can be sent via the webapp, thus provide ample evidence should there be a law case.
