# Problem

As people, we want a free, safe and welcoming environment to live, work, learn and thrive. Technology has the potential in our nation, Nigeria, to help improve the security and provide a safe society. To that end, we agree that now is the time to use technology for good, to be tech proud, and to use technology to keep us safe.

# Proposed Solution

A platform-based application(USSD, web, and mobile) that enables citizens of the society to report crime, rapes or abuses to approved personnel and seek support as soon as possible.

# Proposed Stack

Node, HTML, CSS, vanila js and Postgres

# Benefit

- To provide a platform where security issues can be reported to approved personnels and authority.
- Users will be able to add their families and friends cotacts for security alert during distress.
- The platform will give security insights of locations to users.
- A well detailed data analysis of security events over time in an environment. This will be useful for security agencies and users at large.
