# Problem

As people, we want a free, safe and welcoming environment to live, work, learn and thrive. Technology has the potential in our nation, Nigeria, to help improve the security and provide a safe society. To that end, we agree that now is the time to use technology for good, to be tech proud, and to use technology to keep us safe.

# Proposed Solution

There's a rapid increase in rape cases, crime and abuse of human rights in the country right now, with no quick way to contact the needed authorities to help in such cases.

SafeHaven provides a platform-based application(USSD, web, and mobile) that enables citizens of the society to report crime, rapes or abuses to approved personnel and seek support as quick as possible.

# Proposed Stack

Node, HTML, CSS, vanila js and Postgres

# Benefit

- To provide a platform where security issues can be reported to approved personnels and authority.
- Users will be able to add their families and friends cotacts for security alert during distress.
- The platform will give security insights of locations to users.
- A well detailed data analysis of security events over time in an environment. This will be useful for security agencies and users at large.
- USSD application will make it easy for users without data connection to use the app. 
- Videos footage and images can be sent via the webapp, thus provide ample evidence should there be a law case.
